> twtxt is a decentralised, minimalist microblogging service for
hackers.

You want to get some thoughts out on the internet in a convenient and
slick way while also following the gibberish of others? Instead of
signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform,
getting your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them
in a publicly accessible text file. The URL pointing to this file is
your identity, your account. twtxt then tracks these text files, like
a feedreader, and builds your unique timeline out of them, depending
on which files you track. The format is simple, human readable, and
integrates well with UNIX command line utilities.

tl;dr: twtxt is a CLI tool, as well as a format specification for
self-hosted flat file based microblogging.

Tantek[1]: if you could, it would be great to add its connection
relevance to IndieWeb people and or principles to the dfn and perhaps
expand later in the page with Examples
Tantek[2]: see also text-first
Tantek[3]: Text-first design refers to the practice of designing
information and UIs so they are readable/usable/actionable at least
as basic plain text https://indieweb.org/text-first
