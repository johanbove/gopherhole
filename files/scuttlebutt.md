# What is Secure ScuttleButt? ##

> *Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB)* is a peer-to-peer communication
> protocol, mesh network, and self-hosted social media ecosystem.
> Each user hosts their own content and the content of the peers they
> follow, which provides fault tolerance and eventual consistency.
> Messages are digitally signed and added to an append-only list of
> messages published by an author. SSB is primarily used for
> implementing distributed social networks, and utilizes cryptography
> to assure that content remains unforged as it propagated through
> the network.
