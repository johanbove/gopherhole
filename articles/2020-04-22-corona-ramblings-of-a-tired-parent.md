# Corona Ramblings of a Tired Parent ################################

Eight weeks of spending home office working and taking 24/7 care of
my two and a half year old wonderful boy is starting to bear its
weight on me. Soo tired of spending evenings catching up with work
and not going to bed before 00:30 every - single - day.

I read all these interesting posts here of everyone’s cool projects
and I’m like so jealous of the “free time”. Thank you all for
dedicating your minds and time to SSB by the way! You all rock.
Hoping the schools and kindergartens will go back to normal soon.
