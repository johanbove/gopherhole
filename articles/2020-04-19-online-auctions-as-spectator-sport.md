# Online Auctions as Spectator Sport ################################

Discovered an exciting new online spectator-sport: following Ebay
auctions for rare(ish), yet popular devices.

The [last auction I followed for a Sony MZ-RH1][1] #minidisc player
was a real nail-biter.

[1]: https://www.ebay.de/bfl/viewbids/174252718837?item=174252718837&rt=nc&_trksid=p2047675.l2565

Within the duration of the final 60 seconds four bidders competed
with each other, with the bid going up from €188 to €289.

The winning bid went to someone who made a bid only 4 times for this
item and only followed a single auction in the last period. They won
against someone who, looking at their bidding history, is going
through some effort finding the rare gem.

ps. I am not going to make this a regular report - just thought this
last auction was particular and I was personally glad the winning bid
was just a little bit more than what I offered for a similar device
just last week.
