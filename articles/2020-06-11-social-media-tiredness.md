# Tired of the Social Media rush

All social media feels like standing in the middle of a big hall, a train station waiting area or a really busy event, could be a fair, where you are constantly bombarded from every direction and at every single instance with noise and attention-seeking calls and light-flashes, which are sometimes exchanged by "sponsored messages" for something you don't need.

I think I'm done with it.

I need social media without the feed. Just direct messages and mentions so I can really keep social contact.

Everything else is just noise.

How did people sanely get through plague-years 400 years ago?

They escaped the epicenters, mostly cities, and retired to small villages in the middle of nowhere. Cut off from the decease and most social interaction, which was consecutively kept to a minimum.

They slowed down and focussed on what was really important.

It did wonders for their health and concentration.

Isaac Newton is a good example. I need to be more like him. ([history](https://www.biography.com/news/isaac-newton-quarantine-plague-discoveries))
