# Ivo Bissoli ##

## April 16 2020 

It’s with an extremely heavy heart that I note down that Erica’s
grandfather, Ivo Bissoli from Domegliara near Verona in Italy; who
turned 96 years old last December; was admitted to intensive care
today caused by complications after suffering a COVID-19 infection.

Since the virus already affected his kidneys, the doctors, who are
keeping him in a comatose state, are giving him only a couple of
hours, perhaps days, to live.

We are extremely saddened that due to the quarantine and travel
restrictions, my #family cannot even go see him for a last goodbye.

After a fierce brief battle combating the COVID-19 virus, Ivo’s
immune system and organs lost. He passed away around 11:30 last
night. Our family is in deep grief.
