# Ivo Bissoli #######################################################

It’s with an extremely heavy heart that I note down that Erica’s
grandfather, Ivo Bissoli from Domegliara near Verona in Italy; who
turned 96 years old last December; was admitted to intensive care
today caused by complications after suffering a COVID-19 infection.

Since the virus already affected his kidneys, the doctors, who are
keeping him in a comatose state, are giving him only a couple of
hours, perhaps days, to live.

We are extremely saddened that due to the quarantine and travel
restrictions, my #family cannot even go see him for a last goodbye.
