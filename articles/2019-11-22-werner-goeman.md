# Werner Goeman #####################################################

My mom's brother Werner only became 41. He died on December 26, 1995
after a short intense battle with lung cancer. He was a heavy smoker.

I remember him mostly as a DJ and a computer wizard. I remember he
had boxes full of diskettes filled with early PC games. I wonder now
if he posted anything on a BBS at the time or had his own Gopher site
or even an early HTML website.

I wish he was alive now and could observe how the Internet grew to
what it is today and how computing power encreased exponentially.

I wish he could be here today so I could share with him what I do a
for a living as a Web developer and to be able to share good music.

In 1995 I was only 15 years old and was not into PC much yet. Cancer
sucks.
