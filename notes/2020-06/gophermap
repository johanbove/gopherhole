## Stuff

I've been posting mostly on my Hyperdrive [1] with Beakerbrowser [2]
lately.

It's really fun working on the modules and components using Beaker.
Highly recommend it.

## Family #

We're doing great. B&M made it here from Italy and we're having a
good time spending time together. We are very fortunate and
appreciate the time we have now as a family.
