# November 3rd, 2019 ################################################

## Family ###########################################################

N. woke up during the night, we think his cold is bothering him.
Hopefully he will be better soon.

We video called our families on WhatsApp. I am still amazed how
technology made it so easy to make these video calls. It's wonderful
for our parents and also for N. It's one of the best things of our
current times.

The new phone has a really good camera by the way. So trying to get
used to the feel and the weight.

E. went to see an English language stage play today. She had a fun
time and said the play was excellent.

And I had a really good time playing with N. He is such a smart,
clever, good kid.

We went to this new coffee place and had some chocolate and coffees.
It was raining and N. loved running through the rain water puddles.
He is so amazing! He is a really good runner and I think he's pretty
much athletic. We should really get him into one or even more sports.

He is feisty and really determined; he did not want to eat any
dinner, and got upset about wathing an episode of his favourite
show..  And then, for the first time he followed my movements in the
"Itsy Bitsy Spider" song. Wonderful feeling. We love him so much.

Went with E. and N. to donate blood at the Uniklinik in Düsseldorf.

N. had a good time being amazed by the little train model display of
Baden Baden.

Going to make this a recurring thing again. It worked out going there
by public transport.

N. is still finding his little voice and wants to sometimes seem
bigger than he still is. It's cute, but we feel for hime when it
frustrates him that he cannot communicate to us what he really wants.

## iPhone Woes ######################################################

Looked into getting a case for the iPhone XR - Apple is charging
ridiculous amounts of money for a piece of silicon to wrap around
their already ridiculously expensive hardware. The Apple store in
Düsseldorf was however as packed as ever. Giving me images of the
story of the Mindless Apple-drones in The Simpsons. I didn't get the
case. Will wait for the one from work to arrive.

## Life #############################################################

Decided against buying minced beef meat at the super market today.
Got veggie balls, humush and fish instead. Also got re-usable bottles
in glass and plastic for milk and sparkling water. Wondering if these
co2 home tap systems are better or worse for the environment. Watched
a Vox episode on Water; half-watched the documentary on CRISPR.cas9.

Watching these well-made documentaries inspired new thoughts and
motivations on what and what I should to contribute to humanity. But
what if making sure N. grows up a smart and healthy man is what I am
here for? What if I'm not the star of the show, but merely the
supporting character to the hero? I guess we all like to think we're
the hero in our own shows.

Closed off the shows with an episode on the origins of the character
"!" - the exclamation point. Interesting topic again of which I
really wasn't aware. Can really recommend the Vox Explained series on
Netflix.

# November 1st, 2019 ################################################

## Family ###########################################################

Visited the AquaZoo in Düsseldorf since today is a national day off
and the weather is really drap and rainy. It looked like half of the
parents in Düsseldorf had had the same idea. The aquariums were
crowded and N. is just a little too short to be able to stand on the
ledger to see into the displays. We made the best of it, by avoiding
the main attractions and starting from the upper floors. I like to
think he did enjoy the visit in the end. We took the tram and he
already finds that exciting. On the way back, we had Japanese lunch
at the Eat Tokyo place. We all really liked it. N. had a good
apetite! I enjoyed the curry. Portions and prices are reasonable and
the staff friendly. Only problem is that it can be crowded and the
bathrooms are only reachable through a spiral stair case.

E. and I talked about how another Science museum in the center of
Düsseldorf would really be great for the tourism in the city. There
is simply nothing to do in the centre on days like today. 

While N. was napping I migrated my old work phone, a three year old
iPhone 7, to the new iPhone XR work issued me.

The battery on the 7 is no longer reliable unfortunately for an
otherwise still performant phone. The transfer of the data and the
apps went reasonably well, even the 2FA setup transfer worked, after
briefly syncing it all with iCloud. I had copied all the data from
the old phone to the most recent backup and that made the process
pretty straightforward after I had upgraded the software on the XR to
the latest IOS.

Had some fun with the real-time animated Animoji and the FaceID is
cool, although nothing new since Windows Phone already had some years
ago. It does help to finally have it on the iPhone too. I really
dislike entering passwords. SSH keys and Yubikey's are other
solutions, but biometric authentication like only looking a special
camera is in fact probably the lowest possible secure unlocking
mechanism I can think off.

The hardware of the XR is really slick, but it feels much lumpier and
heavier in my hands than the 7 and I will, in no way, be able to
securily fit it to my bicycle. The 7 was already a little tight.

And then for some reason OneDrive decided to upload ALL the pictures
and videos on the new phone as new images. It's kinda messed up now
on the OneDrive app itself where the pictures all got new "created
at" date stamps. It does seem however that online, and within the iOS
Photo app, all existing pictures still have the correct meta data.

A new month has started so it's time for the monthly Bullet Journal
routing of setting up a new month, migrating existing open tasks and
updating the future log.

Tomorrow we're going to donate some blood at the UniKlinik in
Düsseldorf.

Next week we're going to help out A. moving house and painting.
