# November 6th, 2019 ################################################

## Family ###########################################################

N. had a great day at the Kita. He's been very interactive and is
responding to what we're saying as if he really understands
everything. He definitely does have a determined mind of his own. He
ate a full plate - and more - of pasta with Grandma's meat sauce.  He
got a little upset before when he did not get the full grissino (too
much salt) and for desert he got a bar of Kinder choclate. He wanted
to have an extra one and when I did not allow he got a bit upset.

So we put him to bed a bit earlier today which is definitely not a
bad thing. Going to hit the hay on time myself too.

Installed the Mippaa stair-trainer but unfortunately our stair-case
is spiral and the system does not really work.

## Projects #########################################################

Keeping everything I encounter online and find interesting as
"bookmarks" in my Known site. Pretty neat. Not going to relink all of
these things here however.

Started a "following" page on the same site so I can share my blog
roll.

Listening to the Flemish Nerdland Podcast is good to keep up with my
Flemish and learn about the latest news on science.

## Work #############################################################

Refactoring a previous implementation on how we get data from the API
because the response object is not giving us all the keys and values
we need to build the UI. It's frustrating that we need to do an
additional server request to get a single value. The process got a
little trickier because of how we offer query parameters.

## Family ###########################################################

N. was fantastic today. He's really determined and super cute. It is
really sweet and funny how he is repeating Mommie's Italian phrases.
We caught it on camera.

Managed to get him to eat a full plate of food. He loves salmon.

Got up earlier than usual today and E. brought him home also earlier
to beat the traffic jams in the city.

Friday is the Saint-Martin Parade and we're all going, together with
all the kids from his KITA.

## Known CMS ########################################################

Looking at Webmentions again, testing out "unlisted" posts. Should
they send out Webmention posts? Probably yes. The reasoning behind
the "unlisted" posts is that they don't show up in RSS feeds. When
they contain links to other resources, than they should send out a
webmention to the targets. However by doing this, a link will be made
on the target site back to the "unlisted" post, making it... listed.
So with that logic, "unlisted" posts, should not send out
webmentions.

The DELETE action of Webmentions works in a very clever way by
implementing the status code 410 Gone. Wrote about it on ye olde
Known blog.

hMy "Webmention DELETE" Post	/URL:https://social.johanbove.info/2019/11/05/webmention-delete-testing-with-webmentionrocks

Got news from a fellow Known CMS user that he bodged his son's
website and is having a really tough time getting the data and the
site back online. This triggered me to check my own backup plan and
do an export to XML (RSS) of my Known posts.

Note to self: Make regular full backups and make sure to keep the
file offline.

When posting code-snippets, there are still some design issues; going
to have to take a look at that too.

Oh, and it would be cool to be able to quickly insert the Brid.gy
webmention endpoints into the content publishing forms.

## The House ########################################################

I really need to reach out to the architect tomorrow. We are in
desperate need to clean up the drains of the balcony roofs and we
need to renovate the ancient Velux roof windows. A project on the
www.myhammer.de website would probably help. Going to need to prepare
some information on the projects itself as the entry form on this
site requires quite a lot of details and preferably also pictures.

## Work #############################################################

Problem solving day. Trying to get a sort of German strings to work
with ``String.prototype.localCompare()``.

Organizing tasks in our Sprint plan and making sure we constantly
feed our testing crew with testable stories and deployments.

# November 4th, 2019 ################################################

Short notes today as I really need to catch up on lost sleep. N. has
been a little bad at sleeping through the night again and it is
taking a toll on me.

## Work #############################################################

Progressing on Sprint 7 - finalizing details and resolving some older
lingering issues. We'll need to introduce some changes in the design
to smooth things out and optimize the app for smaller screen
resolutions.

We had a "bomb dismanteling" close to the office. Everybody had to
either leave before 19:00 or stay until the "all clear" signal was
given. Took the wide road around the bomb site.

## Family ###########################################################

The "Environmental Lane" south of Düsseldorf is really messing up E.
& N.'s daily commute back home from Kita and work.

It is taking them twice the time to cover the 25 kms.

N. was really upset when he got home. We are now even considering
that Düsseldorf might not be the right home for us anymore if this
continues.

Angry tweeted the mayor of Düsseldorf in my best German:

> Replying to @OB_ThomasGeisel: Das dritte Umweltspur verpflichtet
> uns, als junge Familie, aus D.  Stadtmitte, aus diese Möglichkeiten
> zu wählen statt eine Stunde lang Stau von Monheim bis Zentrum:
> andere Kita, anderen Job, aus Düsseldorf wegziehen oder ein e-Auto
> kaufen. Düsseldorf ist für uns kein Heim mehr.

> Darum hatten wir lieber das Dieselverbot! Wir habe sehr gern hier
> in Düsseldorf gewohnt und haben selbst sehr viel Geld in unsere
> eigen Wohnung investiert. Das ist leider jetzt alles aus dem
> Fenster.

There, I fixed the issue ... *sigh* ...

We do not know what to do. Selling our place is not - immediately -
an option - it will be very expensive for us, as we still carry a
mortgage, and the house itself still requires renovations to make it
more attractive. Changing jobs is not an option, changing Kitas might
be, but poor little N. will suffer from that grately and there are no
spots available in the city anyway.

No, for us, the only solution is that if the city of Düsseldorf needs
to fix the CO2 pollution around the measuring station in the
Corneliusstrasse, is that they forbid diesel trucks, busses and cars
from using that street, or at least introduce a speed limit of 30 km
per hour.

This third "umweltspur" is causing way more issues than it brings any
solutions to the environmental issue. If only the mayor would not be
so stubborn about it.

## Gophering ########################################################

Connected this site to my GitHub account for an extra backup and a
way to edit the content even remotely. The GitHub online editor tools
are not perfect and I cannot publish, but I can still use to prepare
for later, so that gives this site an extra way for me to add some
use to it.

## iPhone ###########################################################

Uninstalled the extremely buggy IOS 13 Mail app and replaced it with
Microsoft's Outlook.

# November 3rd, 2019 ################################################

## Family ###########################################################

N. woke up during the night, we think his cold is bothering him.
Hopefully he will be better soon.

We video called our families on WhatsApp. I am still amazed how
technology made it so easy to make these video calls. It's wonderful
for our parents and also for N. It's one of the best things of our
current times.

The new phone has a really good camera by the way. So trying to get
used to the feel and the weight.

E. went to see an English language stage play today. She had a fun
time and said the play was excellent.

And I had a really good time playing with N. He is such a smart,
clever, good kid.

We went to this new coffee place and had some chocolate and coffees.
It was raining and N. loved running through the rain water puddles.
He is so amazing! He is a really good runner and I think he's pretty
much athletic. We should really get him into one or even more sports.

He is feisty and really determined; he did not want to eat any
dinner, and got really upset about not allowed to watch an episode of
his favourite show.  And then, for the first time he followed my
movements in the "Itsy Bitsy Spider" song. Wonderful feeling.

We love him so much.

## Family ###########################################################

Went with E. and N. to donate blood at the Uniklinik in Düsseldorf.

N. had a good time being amazed by the little train model display of
Baden Baden.

Going to make this a recurring thing again. It worked out going there
by public transport.

N. is still finding his little voice and wants to sometimes seem
bigger than he still is. It's cute, but we feel for hime when it
frustrates him that he cannot communicate to us what he really wants.

## iPhone Woes ######################################################

Looked into getting a case for the iPhone XR - Apple is charging
ridiculous amounts of money for a piece of silicon to wrap around
their already ridiculously expensive hardware. The Apple store in
Düsseldorf was however as packed as ever. Giving me images of the
story of the Mindless Apple-drones in The Simpsons. I didn't get the
case. Will wait for the one from work to arrive.

## Life #############################################################

Decided against buying minced beef meat at the super market today.
Got veggie balls, humush and fish instead. Also got re-usable bottles
in glass and plastic for milk and sparkling water. Wondering if these
co2 home tap systems are better or worse for the environment. Watched
a Vox episode on Water; half-watched the documentary on CRISPR.cas9.

Watching these well-made documentaries inspired new thoughts and
motivations on what and what I should to contribute to humanity. But
what if making sure N. grows up a smart and healthy man is what I am
here for? What if I'm not the star of the show, but merely the
supporting character to the hero? I guess we all like to think we're
the hero in our own shows.

Closed off the shows with an episode on the origins of the character
"!" - the exclamation point. Interesting topic again of which I
really wasn't aware. Can really recommend the Vox Explained series on
Netflix.

# November 1st, 2019 ################################################

## Family ###########################################################

Visited the AquaZoo in Düsseldorf since today is a national day off
and the weather is really drap and rainy. It looked like half of the
parents in Düsseldorf had had the same idea. The aquariums were
crowded and N. is just a little too short to be able to stand on the
ledger to see into the displays. We made the best of it, by avoiding
the main attractions and starting from the upper floors. I like to
think he did enjoy the visit in the end. We took the tram and he
already finds that exciting. On the way back, we had Japanese lunch
at the Eat Tokyo place. We all really liked it. N. had a good
apetite! I enjoyed the curry. Portions and prices are reasonable and
the staff friendly. Only problem is that it can be crowded and the
bathrooms are only reachable through a spiral stair case.

E. and I talked about how another Science museum in the center of
Düsseldorf would really be great for the tourism in the city. There
is simply nothing to do in the centre on days like today. 

While N. was napping I migrated my old work phone, a three year old
iPhone 7, to the new iPhone XR work issued me.

The battery on the 7 is no longer reliable unfortunately for an
otherwise still performant phone. The transfer of the data and the
apps went reasonably well, even the 2FA setup transfer worked, after
briefly syncing it all with iCloud. I had copied all the data from
the old phone to the most recent backup and that made the process
pretty straightforward after I had upgraded the software on the XR to
the latest IOS.

Had some fun with the real-time animated Animoji and the FaceID is
cool, although nothing new since Windows Phone already had some years
ago. It does help to finally have it on the iPhone too. I really
dislike entering passwords. SSH keys and Yubikey's are other
solutions, but biometric authentication like only looking a special
camera is in fact probably the lowest possible secure unlocking
mechanism I can think off.

The hardware of the XR is really slick, but it feels much lumpier and
heavier in my hands than the 7 and I will, in no way, be able to
securily fit it to my bicycle. The 7 was already a little tight.

And then for some reason OneDrive decided to upload ALL the pictures
and videos on the new phone as new images. It's kinda messed up now
on the OneDrive app itself where the pictures all got new "created
at" date stamps. It does seem however that online, and within the iOS
Photo app, all existing pictures still have the correct meta data.

A new month has started so it's time for the monthly Bullet Journal
routing of setting up a new month, migrating existing open tasks and
updating the future log.

Tomorrow we're going to donate some blood at the UniKlinik in
Düsseldorf.

Next week we're going to help out A. moving house and painting.
