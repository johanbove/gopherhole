 -- Lots of ideas, simply not enough time to process them all.

Focus is what I need. When I was 16 I went through a dark period of
my life and my Mom even went to seek professional help, came back
with advice that I should write; and I did. My writing is not any
good for anyone else but myself, but it really helps refocussing on
the things and stuff that really matters. Channeling ideas and
inklings into something as concrete as a well-formatting and
grammatically correct English sentence helps.

However, writing these ideas and thoughts down by hand in a notebook
works even better as there are way less distractions possible,
compared to a PC with a browser. A digital notebook does however
offer other advantages. Obviously, digital files are harder to lose,
if you keep everything stored on good hardware and make 3-2-1 backup
copies. Paper notebooks are very susceptible to water, dirt and fire.
And making "backups" is really difficult, unless you have one of
those super copy-machines available.

Got inspired by reading the following phlog post by James Tomasino:

1re: gopher resilliency	/phlog/20191115-re-gopher-resiliency	gopher.black

On another note: I changed my .vimrc configuration to no longer
format as I type, but I'm displaying a line at the 70 column to show
me where to return to the next line. The automatic reformatting of
paragraphs turned out to be annoying while using Vim for more than
writing Gopher notes.

As you might have guessed already, only me needed this post and
nobody else. That's the beauty of the Small Internet on Gopher.

# Monday, November 18th, 2019 #######################################

Working from home today as the Kita is closed. It is wonderful being
around N. but at the same time taking care of him while also working
is totally exhausting. I am physically tired when I'm writing this.
Hard to concentrate with an attention devouring little lovely cute
toddler around. But in the end I did manage to deliver some work done
and was able to attend my required meetings.

His cold seems better, but I am still worried about the temperature
and the air quality in his room. It's getting humid and not super
warm. Going to need to vent out the room tomorrow with the windows
wide open. And I really need to start looking for a roofer who can
install us new Velux windows for a good price, plus advice us on how
to recuperate the cost by applying some nice tax-breaks offered by
NRW and the city of Düsseldorf.

Watching TV helped keep him calm and I feel somewhat bad about it. We
don't have a babysit still, so it was the only thing we could do.

It has been raining constantly since the last couple of days. Great
for the plants and our water supply, but it sucks for the people
building up the Düsseldorfer christmas markets.

N.'s new jacket got ripped under his arms and we were lucky enough to
get it fixed within the day thanks to the help of a nice tailor-lady
across the street. He enjoyed eating the crepe with chocolate so much
yesterday his jacket was full of it.

Got inspired by the Beyond Tellerrand video. Asking Kicks Condor if
they want to come to Europe for a talk and to also share with us
their ideas of the Internet.

Gave @cleverdevil 8 USD worth of Lumens, for a virtual beer. I sent
him the coins using Keybase command line program, completely secure.
Awesome stuff.

```
$ keybase wallet send cleverdevil 8 USD
```

The washing machine is done. Time to go.

# Sunday, November 17th, 2019 #######################################

Had an easy-going day at home and in Düsseldorf. N. had his first
crepe with chocolate at the seasonal ice-skating ring. We spent most
part of the day at home. Playing in and around the couch.
He again had not a great night and woke me up multiple times. We got
out of bed a bit later than usual. This moved ahead all other events
of the day. E. made great food. N. had his first fajita's and
tortillas. He loves eating raw peppers, but did not really enjoy them
cooked.

Totally tired, but happy and - for now - also healthy.

Playing around with the Lotto.de statistics and create a "Python
Lotto" parser using the "Barometer" json endpoint. It returns the
next five numbers which have not been drawn for the longest period.
Planning to turn this into a "lotto lucky draw" system with actual
statistical data. Could be perhaps something fun to mess around with
in relation to learning how to code an IA (Tensorflow).

Got a little inspired by the expositions at the Deloitte For Future
event after all.

Finally received the next round of Lumens from the popular and
notorious Keybase Stellar Spacedrop. Total value of the Lumens is
$49.93.

Now I only need to see what to do with these. Move them to LTC or
just keep them for keep-sake as the XLM crypto token seems to become
more popular because of these drops. Who's to know?

Current Lumens total: 774.673 XLM
Notional Value: $ 55.614 USD or € 50.284 EUR

If you feel inclined to send me coins, my Stellar wallet is:

# Saturday, November 16th, 2019 #####################################

Life has finally caught up with my GopherHole Phlogging so I missed a
couple of days in the log. As you can see...

Thursday evening I attended a session about bringing-up your child in
a multi-lingual home. It was well executed and the experience was
worth it. Collected a bunch of tips and got loads of good book and
article references which I will probably share here shortly.

I got stuck in our building's elevator for about twenty minutes. The
alarm telephone is really worth the effort. I declared thursday to be
"mechanical and electrical engineer appreciation day".

Listened to the excellent and very funny podcast Nerdland.be - very
interesting topics on the latest happenings in science and tech land.
But brought in a very funny way. Laughed-out-loud a couple of times
and my colleagues looked funny at me.

The Bangle.js Kickstarter campaign is a major success! At the time of
writing this, it got funded over 400%.

Friday was "Deloitte For Future" event in Düsseldorf and I talked to a
lot of people and attended a presentation on blockchain and
smart-contracts. Was good seeing some colleagues I had not talked to
in a while again too. The Pepper robot was greeting people and I won
a Deloitte branded bamboo wireless charging pad.

## Family ###########################################################

N. is greater than ever. Very interactive and he is very smart.  He's
starting to use a lot more words even than last week and since
recently also started combining sounds and making more complex
phrases. He's really agile as well. Only problem is his eating
pattern is very eradic. We know he likes grilled salmon for instance,
but for some reason he simply refuses to eat a lot. We're going to
monitor his weight, but are not worried about it. Last week his
sleeping has also not been the best with only a couple of nights
where he really slept through the night. Hopefully this will improve
soon too.

---

# Wednesday, November 13th, 2019 ####################################

It's been busy evenings and I have been focused on getting work done
because of our deadlines, therefore I wasn't able to keep up with the
daily logs.

All is well, and we had a good week until now. Made a lot of notes in
my Bullet Journal, and in the compagnon app, so I will be copying
over the notes from the app my journal tonight.

Check my Twtxt updates and also my updates on
https://social.johanbove.info to see more about what I have been up
to in the last couple of days.

- Excited for the launch on Kickstarter of the Bangle.js project.
- Friday I'm attending a work event to share ideas and improve the
  World... one donation at the time. Going to try to achieve a
  contribution to funding Child Hood cancer at Deloitte.

## Friends & Family #################################################

Helped out our friend A.B. moving her house by looking after her baby
boy for a couple of hours while she painted her new place. Gave me an
impression of how parents of multiple children are spending their
days. N. had fun while H. was here, although it took him some time to
start trusting H. for not "stealing" his toys.

Had a really good day actually, and we finished by having chocolates
and sweets at a caffé in town.

## Known ############################################################

When N. was in bed I discovered that the Akismet spam filter of my
Known site was blocking legit comments sent as webmentions, so I had
to investigate and figure out why. The Akismet plugin is missing full
debug log output so I added more debug out statements which are
printed in the web server's error log. I also looked at how we could
do a HAM submit to Akismet to prevent such legit comments to be
blocked in the first place. The Akismet ham API documentation allows
for building a basic HAM submit form, and I also figured out how to
build such a form within the core Known code. But making it actually
functional for everyone will require actually storing annotations
which are flagged as spam within the DB or some other persistent
storage. I am not yet comfortable messing about with the Known CMS DB
yet.

# Saturday, November 9th, 2019 ######################################

## Family ###########################################################

N. was good and playful today. He's a handful though. He loves to eat
bread and chocolate is quickly becoming his favourit food. He's not
really brushing his teeth properly, so I'm getting a little worried
for caries. 

Helped out A.B. move houses by carrying boxes down into the trailer.
She's moving only one street away so we actually carried some lighter
bags and boxes on foot. Her new place is very welcome improvement on
her old cramped, cold place. The apartment is recently renovated and
has a good front door and a new elevator. It's located in a quiet,
one-way street. Tomrrow we're baby sitting her baby boy so she can
get some painting done.

We went briefly to the playground where N. enjoyed the swing,
especially when I made it twist around his own axis. He has such a
sweet laugh.

We had a pizza night. N. didn't eat much. Perhaps due to that he did
ate a lot of fruit and some Plasmon cookies before.

E. was absolutely exhausted and took a long nap, when N. was napping
too. While they were both in dreamland I took care of getting
groceries and getting rid of the recycables. Also went to Conrad to
buy two E14 LED lamps to put into the new wall lights we got. Did not
buy the more expense Philips Hue lights yet until I figure out if
there is a dimmer switch on the wall plugs or not. Going to check
this later this week, perhaps tomorrow.

Called E.'s parents on WhatsApp. N. interacted a bit.

Helped out J.L. with some tips on where to eat wienerschnitzel in
Düsseldorf. He's here for only one night. 

I'm too tired to go out. It's intense with N. all day long.

# Friday, November 8th, 2019 ########################################

## Family ###########################################################

Went to N.'s Kita to pick him up together with E. and to join the
other kids, parents and teachers in the yearly Saint-Martin's lantern
parade. It's a fun activity for the kids where they make their own
lanterns, often together with the parents, and then go on a parade at
dusk until the sun sets, while walking through town holding their
lanterns. There is a big wood fire burning and lots of bands play
music along the route. At the end, or before or during, the kids all
get a bag of goodies, including a bread man holding a pipe. Perhaps
I'll write about this in a later post.

N. was really good and we think he enjoyed it. Especially since his
best friend T. was there too with his dad. N. and T. had a lot of fun
together chasing each other and just mimicking each other. They are
really cute.

## Work #############################################################

An important aspect of my job is to understand a story and a proposed
feature and translate the requirements into code. Sometimes we get
different ideas of what is expected from us and then it is really
important we listen to one another in order to not get lost in our
opinions. My colleagues are pretty good at that and that makes the
daily job a lot more friendlier and productive. We sometimes agree to
disagree and leave it up to an expert to decide.

# Thursday, November 7th, 2019 ######################################

## Work #############################################################

Busy day today as I am starting to feel some pressure of the
upcoming deadline. A process I designed is currently actually being
used and it seems that it is not entirely doing what it should be
doing. A little bit frustrating. Spent a large part of the day
setting up the local test API to mimic the dynamic responses.

I'm also going to be "counselor" for a colleague of mine. Kind of
like a manager, but not really. Reviewing self-evaluation forms and
supporting the career opportunities of the counselee. It's an
important responsibility and after three years at Deloitte Digital
I'm ready for it.

Got great news from work too. Cannot disclose any details about it
yet, but the news made E. very happy. I hope I will be able to share
more about in a future update.

## Family ###########################################################

N. is getting rid of his cold and is eating well. He's also playful
and curious. He's singing, dancing and jumping. Yet, when we want to
get him dressed, putting pants, sock and shoes on, he will be
screaming and kicking. He gets really upset about it. He also got
upset when we needed to change his diaper. Hoping it is a growing
phase related to hormones he is going through.

## House ############################################################

The new wall lights arrived. Looking nice, but I do need to buy two
extra E14 LED lamps. Looking at the Philips Hue lamps. Going to try
to install it this weekend after helping A.

# Wednesday, November 6th, 2019 #####################################

## Family ###########################################################

N. had a great day at the Kita. He's been very interactive and is
responding to what we're saying as if he really understands
everything. He definitely does have a determined mind of his own. He
ate a full plate - and more - of pasta with Grandma's meat sauce.  He
got a little upset before when he did not get the full grissino (too
much salt) and for desert he got a bar of Kinder choclate. He wanted
to have an extra one and when I did not allow he got a bit upset.

So we put him to bed a bit earlier today which is definitely not a
bad thing. Going to hit the hay on time myself too.

Installed the Mippaa stair-trainer but unfortunately our stair-case
is spiral and the system does not really work.

## Projects #########################################################

Keeping everything I encounter online and find interesting as
"bookmarks" in my Known site. Pretty neat. Not going to relink all of
these things here however. Also looked at the `/stream` page.

Got some warming compliments from fellow Indiewebbers. It's a cool
community.

hIndieweb.org Homepage	/URL:http://indieweb.org

Started a "following" page on the same site so I can share my blog
roll.

Listening to the Flemish Nerdland Podcast is good to keep up with my
Flemish and learn about the latest news on science.

hNerdland Podcast Site	/URL:https://nerdland.be/

## Work #############################################################

Refactoring a previous implementation on how we get data from the API
because the response object is not giving us all the keys and values
we need to build the UI. It's frustrating that we need to do an
additional server request to get a single value. The process got a
little trickier because of how we offer query parameters.

# Tuesday, November 5th, 2019 #######################################

## Family ###########################################################

N. was fantastic today. He's really determined and super cute. It is
really sweet and funny how he is repeating Mommie's Italian phrases.
We caught it on camera.

Managed to get him to eat a full plate of food. He loves salmon.

Got up earlier than usual today and E. brought him home also earlier
to beat the traffic jams in the city.

Friday is the Saint-Martin Parade and we're all going, together with
all the kids from his KITA.

## Known CMS ########################################################

Looking at Webmentions again, testing out "unlisted" posts. Should
they send out Webmention posts? Probably yes. The reasoning behind
the "unlisted" posts is that they don't show up in RSS feeds. When
they contain links to other resources, than they should send out a
webmention to the targets. However by doing this, a link will be made
on the target site back to the "unlisted" post, making it... listed.
So with that logic, "unlisted" posts, should not send out
webmentions.

The DELETE action of Webmentions works in a very clever way by
implementing the status code 410 Gone. Wrote about it on ye olde
Known blog.

hMy "Webmention DELETE" Post	/URL:https://social.johanbove.info/2019/11/05/webmention-delete-testing-with-webmentionrocks

Got news from a fellow Known CMS user that he bodged his son's
website and is having a really tough time getting the data and the
site back online. This triggered me to check my own backup plan and
do an export to XML (RSS) of my Known posts.

Note to self: Make regular full backups and make sure to keep the
file offline.

When posting code-snippets, there are still some design issues; going
to have to take a look at that too.

Oh, and it would be cool to be able to quickly insert the Brid.gy
webmention endpoints into the content publishing forms.

## The House ########################################################

I really need to reach out to the architect tomorrow. We are in
desperate need to clean up the drains of the balcony roofs and we
need to renovate the ancient Velux roof windows. A project on the
www.myhammer.de website would probably help. Going to need to prepare
some information on the projects itself as the entry form on this
site requires quite a lot of details and preferably also pictures.

## Work #############################################################

Problem solving day. Trying to get a sort of German strings to work
with ``String.prototype.localCompare()``.

Organizing tasks in our Sprint plan and making sure we constantly
feed our testing crew with testable stories and deployments.

# Monday, November 4th, 2019 ########################################

Short notes today as I really need to catch up on lost sleep. N. has
been a little bad at sleeping through the night again and it is
taking a toll on me.

## Work #############################################################

Progressing on Sprint 7 - finalizing details and resolving some older
lingering issues. We'll need to introduce some changes in the design
to smooth things out and optimize the app for smaller screen
resolutions.

We had a "bomb dismanteling" close to the office. Everybody had to
either leave before 19:00 or stay until the "all clear" signal was
given. Took the wide road around the bomb site.

## Family ###########################################################

The "Environmental Lane" south of Düsseldorf is really messing up E.
& N.'s daily commute back home from Kita and work.

It is taking them twice the time to cover the 25 kms.

N. was really upset when he got home. We are now even considering
that Düsseldorf might not be the right home for us anymore if this
continues.

Angry tweeted the mayor of Düsseldorf in my best German:

> Replying to @OB_ThomasGeisel: Das dritte Umweltspur verpflichtet
> uns, als junge Familie, aus D.  Stadtmitte, aus diese Möglichkeiten
> zu wählen statt eine Stunde lang Stau von Monheim bis Zentrum:
> andere Kita, anderen Job, aus Düsseldorf wegziehen oder ein e-Auto
> kaufen. Düsseldorf ist für uns kein Heim mehr.

> Darum hatten wir lieber das Dieselverbot! Wir habe sehr gern hier
> in Düsseldorf gewohnt und haben selbst sehr viel Geld in unsere
> eigen Wohnung investiert. Das ist leider jetzt alles aus dem
> Fenster.

There, I fixed the issue ... *sigh* ...

We do not know what to do. Selling our place is not - immediately -
an option - it will be very expensive for us, as we still carry a
mortgage, and the house itself still requires renovations to make it
more attractive. Changing jobs is not an option, changing Kitas might
be, but poor little N. will suffer from that grately and there are no
spots available in the city anyway.

No, for us, the only solution is that if the city of Düsseldorf needs
to fix the CO2 pollution around the measuring station in the
Corneliusstrasse, is that they forbid diesel trucks, busses and cars
from using that street, or at least introduce a speed limit of 30 km
per hour.

This third "umweltspur" is causing way more issues than it brings any
solutions to the environmental issue. If only the mayor would not be
so stubborn about it.

## Gophering ########################################################

Connected this site to my GitHub account for an extra backup and a
way to edit the content even remotely. The GitHub online editor tools
are not perfect and I cannot publish, but I can still use to prepare
for later, so that gives this site an extra way for me to add some
use to it.

## iPhone ###########################################################

Uninstalled the extremely buggy IOS 13 Mail app and replaced it with
Microsoft's Outlook.

# Sunday, November 3rd, 2019 ########################################

## Family ###########################################################

N. woke up during the night, we think his cold is bothering him.
Hopefully he will be better soon.

We video called our families on WhatsApp. I am still amazed how
technology made it so easy to make these video calls. It's wonderful
for our parents and also for N. It's one of the best things of our
current times.

The new phone has a really good camera by the way. So trying to get
used to the feel and the weight.

E. went to see an English language stage play today. She had a fun
time and said the play was excellent.

And I had a really good time playing with N. He is such a smart,
clever, good kid.

We went to this new coffee place and had some chocolate and coffees.
It was raining and N. loved running through the rain water puddles.
He is so amazing! He is a really good runner and I think he's pretty
much athletic. We should really get him into one or even more sports.

He is feisty and really determined; he did not want to eat any
dinner, and got really upset about not allowed to watch an episode of
his favourite show.  And then, for the first time he followed my
movements in the "Itsy Bitsy Spider" song. Wonderful feeling.

We love him so much.

# Saturday, November 2nd, 2019 ######################################

## Family ###########################################################

Went with E. and N. to donate blood at the Uniklinik in Düsseldorf.

N. had a good time being amazed by the little train model display of
Baden Baden.

Going to make this a recurring thing again. It worked out going there
by public transport.

N. is still finding his little voice and wants to sometimes seem
bigger than he still is. It's cute, but we feel for hime when it
frustrates him that he cannot communicate to us what he really wants.

## iPhone Woes ######################################################

Looked into getting a case for the iPhone XR - Apple is charging
ridiculous amounts of money for a piece of silicon to wrap around
their already ridiculously expensive hardware. The Apple store in
Düsseldorf was however as packed as ever. Giving me images of the
story of the Mindless Apple-drones in The Simpsons. I didn't get the
case. Will wait for the one from work to arrive.

## Life #############################################################

Decided against buying minced beef meat at the super market today.
Got veggie balls, humush and fish instead. Also got re-usable bottles
in glass and plastic for milk and sparkling water. Wondering if these
co2 home tap systems are better or worse for the environment. Watched
a Vox episode on Water; half-watched the documentary on CRISPR.cas9.

Watching these well-made documentaries inspired new thoughts and
motivations on what and what I should to contribute to humanity. But
what if making sure N. grows up a smart and healthy man is what I am
here for? What if I'm not the star of the show, but merely the
supporting character to the hero? I guess we all like to think we're
the hero in our own shows.

Closed off the shows with an episode on the origins of the character
"!" - the exclamation point. Interesting topic again of which I
really wasn't aware. Can really recommend the Vox Explained series on
Netflix.

# Friday, November 1st, 2019 ########################################

## Family ###########################################################

Visited the AquaZoo in Düsseldorf since today is a national day off
and the weather is really drap and rainy. It looked like half of the
parents in Düsseldorf had had the same idea. The aquariums were
crowded and N. is just a little too short to be able to stand on the
ledger to see into the displays. We made the best of it, by avoiding
the main attractions and starting from the upper floors. I like to
think he did enjoy the visit in the end. We took the tram and he
already finds that exciting. On the way back, we had Japanese lunch
at the Eat Tokyo place. We all really liked it. N. had a good
apetite! I enjoyed the curry. Portions and prices are reasonable and
the staff friendly. Only problem is that it can be crowded and the
bathrooms are only reachable through a spiral stair case.

E. and I talked about how another Science museum in the center of
Düsseldorf would really be great for the tourism in the city. There
is simply nothing to do in the centre on days like today. 

While N. was napping I migrated my old work phone, a three year old
iPhone 7, to the new iPhone XR work issued me.

The battery on the 7 is no longer reliable unfortunately for an
otherwise still performant phone. The transfer of the data and the
apps went reasonably well, even the 2FA setup transfer worked, after
briefly syncing it all with iCloud. I had copied all the data from
the old phone to the most recent backup and that made the process
pretty straightforward after I had upgraded the software on the XR to
the latest IOS.

Had some fun with the real-time animated Animoji and the FaceID is
cool, although nothing new since Windows Phone already had some years
ago. It does help to finally have it on the iPhone too. I really
dislike entering passwords. SSH keys and Yubikey's are other
solutions, but biometric authentication like only looking a special
camera is in fact probably the lowest possible secure unlocking
mechanism I can think off.

The hardware of the XR is really slick, but it feels much lumpier and
heavier in my hands than the 7 and I will, in no way, be able to
securily fit it to my bicycle. The 7 was already a little tight.

And then for some reason OneDrive decided to upload ALL the pictures
and videos on the new phone as new images. It's kinda messed up now
on the OneDrive app itself where the pictures all got new "created
at" date stamps. It does seem however that online, and within the iOS
Photo app, all existing pictures still have the correct meta data.

A new month has started so it's time for the monthly Bullet Journal
routing of setting up a new month, migrating existing open tasks and
updating the future log.

Tomorrow we're going to donate some blood at the UniKlinik in
Düsseldorf.

Next week we're going to help out A. moving house and painting.
