Visited the AquaZoo in Düsseldorf today since today is a national day
off and the weather is really drap and rainy. It looked like half of
the parents in Düsseldorf had had the same idea. The aquariums were
crowded and Nathan is just a little too short to be able to stand on
the ledger to see into the displays. We made the best of it, by
avoiding the main attractions and starting from the upper floors. I
like to think he did enjoy the visit in the end. We took the tram and
he already finds that exciting. On the way back, we had Japanese
lunch at the Eat Tokyo place. We all really liked it. Nathan had a
good apetite! I enjoyed the curry. Portions and prices are
reasonable and the staff friendly. Only problem is that it can be
crowded and the bathrooms are only reachable through a spiral stair
case.

Erica and I talked about how another Science museum in the center of
Düsseldorf would really be great for the tourism in the city. There
is simply nothing to do in the centre on days like today. 

While Nathan was napping I migrated my old work phone, an iPhone 7,
to the new iPhone XR they issued me. All went reasonably well, even
transfering the 2FA set up, except for the OneDrive "Camera Roll"
upload. I had copied all the data from the old phone to the most
recent backup.

And then for some reason OneDrive decided to upload ALL the
pictures and videos on the new phone as new images. It's kinda
message up now on the OneDrive app itself where the pictures all got
new "created at" date stamps. It does seem however that online and
within the actual Photo app all pictures are still set with the
correct meta data.

A new month has started so it's time for the monthly Bullet Journal
routing of setting up a new month, migrating existing open tasks and
updating the future log.
