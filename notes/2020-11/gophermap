## Stuff ##

Back on Gopher after a few months playing around with Hyperdrives until
I lost the private key to the drives because of a backup screw-up and
I'm now stuck with hyperdrives I'm no longer the owner of and nobody
can edit. Shucks. It's a pretty big known issue with Beaker and
Hyperdrives in general.

So here I am, writing happily and swiftly again in Gopher. At least, I
actually have a bit more control over how this data is stored.

Hyperdrives and peer-to-peer has pretty complex data juggling going on
in its internals and that makes it difficult to grasp sometimes.

Thinking about moving this site to the Gemini [1] protocol and burrowing
this Gopher site for good...

Created my own Gemini Pod: gemini://gem.johanbove.info [2]

## Family #

We're doing good, considering we're in the middle of a light-lockdown
here in Germany. Covid is still a high risk and it's weighing down on
us. Luckily we still have our phones, the Internet and the classic
post to keep in touch with everyone.
