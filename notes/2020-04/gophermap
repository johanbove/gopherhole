# Monday, April 6th, 2020 ###########################################

Ahoi! Here's to time flying by like pies in the sky. Tempus Fugit.

## Family ###########################################################

The Corona-virus measures are still in place.

It's been six weeks now that I'm forced home-office. Time is moving 
along slowly and in some ways we are finding that we are some what
getting into it. Even when we definitely have our struggles being
basically only with the three of us in close contact, we're still
super close to one another. N. is growing up and talking more and
more and becoming a real person. We love him dearly, even when he has
no interest what-so-ever in eating, except for chocolate. He surely
loves it. He still has his bottle of formula every morning so we hope
that he is getting some required vitamins and other nutrients, but
dinner time and lunch time are not always _fun_ times. He gets bored
by just eating we think. He has been watching a LOT of TV lately.
It's unfortunately the only way we can get him to spend some time on
his own where we can get our daily work-hours in. We even ordered him
his first tablet now, which hopefully won't arrive too late. He is 
very clever and can loves listing the all the letters of the English
alphabet. The other day I "caught" him in his little bed counting and
by himself he counted up to twelve. He is almost 2,5 years old now.
We're so proud!

## Stuff ############################################################

I have won an auction on Ebay, buying an almost 20-year old Sony
MZ-R500 MiniDisc player / recorder after being reminded how cool
MiniDiscs really were and how futuristic these digital devices still
are. I used to own one, but the loading mechanism broke, and I threw
it out in the recycling center. But thanks to a post on Scuttlebutt
about "International MiniDisc" day, I learned that there is still a
community out there into listening to digital audio cassettes and
recording the old-school way by simply line-in recording.

So I'm planning to move some music from my Laptop's Media Monkey
collection from time to time. Unfortunately I also tossed out all my
old minidiscs!  Which was a really stupid thing to do... Anyhow, at
the time it never crossed my mind to actually try to sell the discs
on the Internet.

I downloaded Zip archives of WikiPedia and other huge data archives
and stored them on my hard-drive, just so, you know, in case the shit
hits the fan and society disappears, N. could still look up something
and learn while even being offline. He'll need a Windows machine of
course to be able to read and decrypt the data; but I will figure
this out soon enough. Perhaps I should create new unencrypted hard-
drive partition for exactly this purpose?
