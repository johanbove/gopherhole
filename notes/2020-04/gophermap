## Family ###########################################################

It's hard on N. that we cannot play with him while we're working. And
we also see how he's really missing playing with other kids. He's
mostly watching videos. He loves it so much to play, run and jump,
but during the day, we simply cannot provide him all the attention he
needs. Of course we try to eat as healthy as possible and take
breaks, but it's definitely different. Our jobs are also suffering
from the lack of 100% focus. Especially during long meeting calls,
it's hard to make sure E. can fully focus. We're considering getting
help from the PME family service as it looks like the KITA will be
closed until at least the end of May.

## Stuff ############################################################

I did it. I was like, no one way my bid will be the highest. And then
it was… I won an auction [1] for a Sony MZ-RH1 with working display
and all accessories and the final bid was €286, plus shipping made it
€290,50.

Perhaps it’s because I’ve been stuck in the house for seven weeks and
I’m not really thinking straight; as I went ahead with looking for
this MiniDisc player anyway, against my own good reasoning. There are
more auctions for MZ-RH1s incoming. I think it’s because people have
been cleaning up their cupboards and attic, while being stuck in the
house, that these gems are appearing on Ebay more often now.

Now I need to explain this to my better half…

The USB Type-C extension cables finally arrived and now I can at
least use my desk again as I can keep the MacBook next to me.

## Family

Still everyone we know and love has been spared from Corona, except
for us all being stuck at home.

We had a somewhat tough day to day after getting back to work after
the actually relaxing Easter long weekend.

N. was clearly bored, but also very sweet and clever. He still
watches a lot of TV. Eventually he even gets a bit bored of it and
starts playing with his toys.  It doesn’t take long for him to want
us to join him in the play.

I hope he understands somehow that Mommy and Daddy need to focus on
work during “office hours”.

Today was the first time he deliberately skipped his day-time nap!

## Stuff ############################################################

No reply from the Ebay seller regarding the strange non-delivery of
the USB Type-C extension cables. And I’m disappointed the MiniDisc
recorder wasn’t delivered today. I do understand the strain the
delivery companies and people must be under during these days.

Didn’t get any updates regarding the “weekly menu” site; doesn’t
really matter at this time really.

I was able to set up ScuttleButt Oasis v2.16.0 as an independently
running server which uses the same data as Patchwork. Using Nginx as
a reverse proxy to be able to access the server from anywhere on our
Wlan, yet securing access to it with basic_auth.

It works good, and without any JavaScript! But there is definitely
some room for usability improvements.

Some ideas:

1. Navigational menu on smaller screen sizes (see existing issue)
2. Expanding the “textarea” publishing screen to full-screen for a 
   more focused writing experience.
3. Why aren’t there any “blob” uploads?
4. How do you start a private note to yourself in Oasis?
5. Will private posts show up in the Oasis “Search”?
6. Check if I can get “consolas” to register as the monospace font. 
   Perhaps I can do this in Firefox?

## Personal #########################################################

My seasonal dandruff is flaring up again like crazy and is very
itchy. It’s hard for me not to scratch.

And I’m tired, so I’m signing off now and will try to get some good
night’s rest.

Happy Easter!

## Family ###########################################################

We went for another long walk through the parks in Duesseldorf today.
N. got tired form pushing his tricylce, but still managed to get me
to run some more.

He IS watching TOO much Youtube Kids. Wishing there was a way in the
app to limit which shows he can watch. He can be really stubborn and
it is sometimes tough to teach him that he cannot always have his
way. Like not wearing any pants before going out or only eating
chocolate. Also, we need him to start putting his toys away after
he's done with them.

E. made really good food today, with fresh pasta, asperegus and
shrimp and N. did eat more than yesterday. He was super funny and
cute asking me for "tickle-does". We had a long video chat with B&M.
We're all worried how we will ever be able to travel normally to
Italy again. 

We didn't do anything for Easter however yet. No egg-hunting yet. We
didn't prepare. It's a bit hard when you only have a balcony. E. is
feeling a bit bad about it, but I think we can still catch up
tomorrow.

## Stuff ############################################################

Messing around with Nginx and Oasis on my Ubuntu set up and learned
about the existence of the "Caddy Webserver". Thinking about redoing
my private home-page again with Jekyll as I got it working last week.

Fixed an issue with the v-card to CVF card (h2xv.com) by emailing
Brian Suda, while I actually should have contacted Tantek Celik.

## Family ###########################################################

We're getting by during the Corona Crisis with lots of video calls
with our family in Italy. Wondering how this decease breakout would
have been if we did not have access to Internet and our modern
communication tools. We're using WhatsApp a lot for video calling and
sharing videos and pictures. Every time we do a video call it reminds
me of the futuristic video calling which looked super realistic in
Aliens.

We are considering looking for house-hold help however if this crisis
doesn't settle and N. cannot go to the KITA for ongoing time. It
would really be difficult for us to keep working and taking care of
him in a decent way at the same time. He would be simply watching too
much videos and TV... 

My mom is retiring on December 1st. She's needs a hip replacement
operation, now on the other side. Luckily she is still capable of
riding an electric bicycle which she often uses now to visit my
sister and her kids some kilometers away.

## Stuff ############################################################

Rediscovering my own music collection worth about 30000 tracks -
there are some songs double or even triple times. Keeping it
organized using Media Monkey. It is a very complete and powerful
music cataloguing application which I purschased a "life-time"
license for some years ago. It can be used to stream and sync the
music collection using automatic and manual playlists.

Thinking about how I will use the MiniDiscs recorder. As I wrote
before (perhaps only my BuJo), I would like to preserve some audio
recording on MiniDisc discs just in case all my hard-drives are lost
or inaccessible. The encryption and the dependency on Windows 10
worries me that N. would someday not be able to access anything
anymore I left behind. Worrying about my "digital inheritance" to
him and having access to the physical discs might help to keep at
least something. Perhaps I should keep some data on unencrypted,
simple formatted USB drives, and keep them in the safe for him?

Ahoi! Here's to time flying by like py in the sky. _Tempus Fugit_

## Family ###########################################################

The Corona-virus measures are still in place.

It's been six weeks now that I'm in forced home-office. Time is
moving along slowly and in some ways we are finding that we are some
what getting into it.  Even when we definitely have our struggles
being basically only with the three of us in close contact, we're
still super close to one another. N. is growing up and talking more
and more and becoming a real person. We love him dearly, even when he
has no interest what-so-ever in eating, except for chocolate. He
surely loves it. He still has his bottle of formula every morning so
we hope that he is getting some required vitamins and other
nutrients, but dinner time and lunch time are not always _fun_ times.
He gets bored by just eating we think. He has been watching a LOT of
TV lately.  It's unfortunately the only way we can get him to spend
some time on his own where we can get our daily work-hours in. We
even ordered him his first tablet now, which hopefully won't arrive
too late. He is very clever and can loves listing the all the letters
of the English alphabet. The other day I "caught" him in his little
bed counting and by himself he counted up to twelve. He is almost 2,5
years old now.  We're so proud!

## Stuff ############################################################

I have won an auction on Ebay, buying an almost 20-year old Sony
MZ-R500 MiniDisc player / recorder after being reminded how cool
MiniDiscs really were and how futuristic these digital devices still
are. I used to own one, but the loading mechanism broke, and I threw
it out in the recycling center. But thanks to a post on Scuttlebutt
about "International MiniDisc" day, I learned that there is still a
community out there into listening to digital audio cassettes and
recording the old-school way by simply line-in recording.

So I'm planning to move some music from my Laptop's Media Monkey
collection from time to time. Unfortunately I also tossed out all my
old minidiscs!  Which was a really stupid thing to do... Anyhow, at
the time it never crossed my mind to actually try to sell the discs
on the Internet.

I downloaded Zip archives of WikiPedia and other huge data archives
and stored them on my hard-drive, just so, you know, in case the shit
hits the fan and society disappears, N. could still look up something
and learn while even being offline. He'll need a Windows machine of
course to be able to read and decrypt the data; but I will figure
this out soon enough. Perhaps I should create new unencrypted hard-
drive partition for exactly this purpose?
