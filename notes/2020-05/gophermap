## Family ###########################################################

We're still all at home as the Corona measures have not been loosened
up yet. So the babysit is really good for N. Too bad she cannot stay
longer than a couple of hours a day. At least he's getting to hear some
native German and we have a moment in the day when we can almost
fully concentrate on getting work done.

E. has been working really hard, both for her day job and her extra
activities regarding the Childhood Cancer Awareness programs. She
even skipped a night's sleep to get presentations done. It's hard on
her that most of her colleagues are in the US and this means
basically working double-shifts.

B&M in Italy can now leave their house and they are going for daily
walks in their neighbourhood.

## Stuff ############################################################

Got a couple more MiniDiscs, Sony Neige from Ebay. Also awaiting the
electrec microphone. So I should be able to start recording some
voice notes. Also want to try capturing N.'s little voice and cute
wordsies he's been so keen of using lately.

The discs arrived today and they contain lovely classical music
again.

Happy Labor Day! A new month comes by and a new entry in my Phlog.

## Stuff ############################################################

Rediscovered my old "DJ Odie" DJ mixes from 2003-2005; I had some
brilliant moments for sure, if I may say so myself. Beat-mixing was
something I had a real good feeling for.

I do wish I was able to redo some of he mixes today with some
other songs; feeling my music taste has matured a bit in the last 17
years. I did already forgot a lot of tracks and I wouldn't
knknow where to look for the songs honestly as everything is
now stored in MP3 files organized somewhat in folders.
Most of the music from those days I hardly ever listen to any more.

I never prepared anything, except for maybe the first couple
of tracks. Wondering how I would have ended up if I had done a more
focussed approach to DJing at the time. I did mess up mixes some
times because I wanted to make the cross last as long as possible.

Some songs also didn't age that well.

## Family ###########################################################

We're doing good even-though still holding up at home with the three
of us. I'm N.'s best friend and also his Dad. It's not easy to make a
clear distinction between my two roles. Especially if he expects us
to act and do differently than what he wants at that exact moment.

He's been eating more and is clearly growing taller. He's gaining new
ways of communicating with us every day and week.

We're sad that we're so far away from our families, but still
WhatsApp and sharing pictures helps.
