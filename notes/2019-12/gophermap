# Friday, December 6, 2019 ##########################################

Tired. It's been a long week. Haven't been able to really keep up
with journalling. Hardly managing it using my Bullet Journal.

I've been working on my "Open Productivity" page on my private site.
Using TaskWarrior export to JSON and an upload to my webhost, which
is then picked up by a PHP script to parse out the data as HTML.
I've added bash functions to generate the json files in one command,
and also `csp` everything to my simple, shared web host.

## Family ###########################################################

N. has been sleeping better; adding a LED night light to his room
helped, as he can now find his bottle of water himself without having
to wake up. He still cries if the threw out all three of his
pacifiers.

He seems to be enjoying video calling lately with his grand-parents.

Today was the KITA event; both E. and I are completely exhausted.

We really notice it when B&M aren't here.

It's been getting colder; up to now we haven't had to really turn on
the heat in the living room or hallway. The bedroom on the other
hand has been cold as too much air gathers in the heater. This is due
to not enough heating water being added to the heating system.
Luckily today the plumber came by to add the water. The renovated
system doesn't allow me to add the water myself. The plumber will
make an adjustment to make that possible again.

Rainy and cold wind, is not a good combination to take the bike to
work; yet I managed to do it every day.

## Work #############################################################

The Deloitte Christmas party took place yesterday. Had a good time
seeing old colleagues back and meeting new ones. Left after eating,
around 21:00. I was still in time to help put N. to bed.

## Stuff ############################################################

The SD-card in the Nokia 8110 4G got corrupted. It seems to have been
set to "read-only", but there doesn't seem to be a way to reset this
attribute. The drive is still readable, but it doesn't show any more
in KaiOS. When I open the drive in Windows, I can ready and copy the
data, but cannot format the drive, nor can I make any other changes.

Ben Werd created a plan for the next months working on Known CMS.
Feeling the need to help out with resolving the CSS and JavaScript
issues, but family time and work-time will make it harder for me to
actually deliver anything nice and useful.

Had a though earlier that Known might not be popular amongst devs,
because there is WordPress and Drupal it competes with. And there is
also Node.js and the whole Blockchain ecology which is calling for
people's spare-time; Wondering if there is a market in Africa for 
sites like Known? All it takes is a standard Linux, Apache, MySQL and
PHP stack (LAMP); which should be cheap to run and easy to maintain.
But yet again, all development of the open-source project seems to
take place in the "Western World". Some questions come to mind;

1. Which CMS is popular in Africa?
2. Which web host is most popular in Kenio or Nigeria?
3. How much does it cost to own a domain name in these countries?
4. How do people access the Web?

Assuming one of the hurdles is that most people in Africa probably
don't own laptops or desktops, or have access to a PC. Schools and 
libraries are probably the only places where people have access to
a "work station". Most phone experience are optimized for consuming
content, but not for creating it; expect for the occasional Tweet or
Instagram picture upload. Not sure if there's anything I can do here.

Just thinking about all of this doesn't make any difference.

Funny how I don't dare writing out freely on my HTTP site, as I do
here on the Small Internet. I guess it helps to not have any real
distractions while I'm immersed in the Small Net...

# Monday, December 2, 2019 ##########################################

So I managed to lose an whole entry I started writing in this blog
note. Not a very good start of the month. Writing this in VS Code.

So far for enjoying Vim. It's been cool, but frustrating, even
after months of forcing myself to use Vim as much as possible. It's
just not worth the effort and time really if you can achieve a lot
more user-friendliness using a modern editor like VS Code.
Losing the work was the drop that made the bucket overflow.

## Family ###########################################################

It's been a tough week, with N. getting sick and not being able to
go to the Kita. We had a lot of help from B&M, but they unfortunately
had to return home yesterday.

N. was really good today, until I had to change his diaper and he had
to get ready for dinner. He can be so stubborn! He threw a tantrum
and we cannot keep him sitting on his "time-out" bench anymore as he
is not willing to stay on it, even if we insist. We need to find
some other form of putting him in "time-out"...

## Projects #########################################################

Trying to get my "Open Productivity" system going with using
TaskWarrior and bash scripts, and a very basic PHP script. It works,
but is not optimal. Trying to figure out how to integrate the publish
to the Webhost using TaskWarrior's hooks; but it does not seem to
execute the Bash `aliases`.

Going to try with an actual bash shell script next.
