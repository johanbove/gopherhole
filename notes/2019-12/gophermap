Merry Christmas Small Internet!

Wishing you all a wonderful, loving time with your families and
friends. Don't exagerate with the good things however, especially
take it easy with the sugars and the alcohol. Take care of that
liver.

## Family ######

Family is doing good. N. is great and getting more like a little boy
every day. He's really communicative and energic. He's definitely
an active kid.

B & M made it to DÃ¼sseldorf again for the holidays. E.'s brother D.
also came over from Austria. It's a full house here at times, but
that is what the end-of-year holidays should be all about.

## Stuff #######

I really do not enjoy typing on the work MacBook keyboard. It feels
and sounds horrible.

Also feeling less and less "enjoyment" using the Nokia 8110 4G phone.
The keyboard experience really forces oneself to avoid using the
phone for anything but leaving voice messages or calling. The
WhatsApp user experience is close to terrible. Especially since it
looks like Nokia and HMD Global and Facebook are not willing to
invest any more time in making the WhatsApp on the phone less
painfull to use. So today I'm again considering getting an Android
based personal phone. Checking out if the Fairphone 3 might be good.
The not-trivial price-tag however is holding me back a little.

And we're back at writing once a week. We're alive and kicking, but
we all have a nasty cold. We're all sniffling and coughing.
Not a lot of fun and we're using a ton of paper towels.

N. weighs 12 kg and is 86 cm tall now. His U7 examination went good!

We're planning for the Christmas events and ordered a lot of presents
for everybody!

I am still on the same project at work. Got stuck a little with a
challenging problem, and reworked an over-complicated solution into
a simpler way of dealing with the expected effect and usability.

Writing this in VS Code and it keeps suggesting auto-completing words.
How can I turn that off? It seems to be related to "Trigger Suggest".

Concentrated on my TaskWarrior tasks on my home machine and was able
to make the "Open Productivity" page to look nice; got inspired by
a BladeRunner screenshot; took out the colors and found a cool
looking web terminal-style web font.

I really need to be able to write these things out of my mind. It's
still not a good memoir or auto-biographie, but it helps me relax.

Task and todos keep popping up in my head as I'm writing this.
I've turned off the "Word suggestions" in VS Code for a more focussed
experience.

What happened this week?

Apparently the end of the year is nearing and everyone is super
excited about the holidays coming. I'm taking it more like one day
at a time; Perhaps it's the realization that with the coming end
of year, it's also the end of this decennium; we're moving into the
2020s. This _is_ freaking me out a little. Especially since I'm
somewhat disappointed to the state of the World; somehow imagined
the "future" to be, better, more like Star Trek; it looks like
however we're going for a future which is more like BladeRunner.
Which looks cool in a movie, but it's not the World I want to see
my son grow up in.

Waarom schrijf ik niet wat meer in het Nederlands? Deze week nog
in mijn hoofd bezig geweest met hoeveel ik Vlaams eigenlijk mis.
Ik woon ondertussen al tien jaar in Duitsland en ben al die tijd
in het Engels of in het Duits aan het praten geweest. Heel weinig
kan ik nog eens in het Vlaams iets zeggen. Het verlies van je
moedertaal is een vreemd besef.

Tired. It's been a long week. Haven't been able to really keep up
with journalling. Hardly managing it using my Bullet Journal.

I've been working on my "Open Productivity" page on my private site.
Using TaskWarrior export to JSON and an upload to my webhost, which
is then picked up by a PHP script to parse out the data as HTML.
I've added bash functions to generate the json files in one command,
and also `csp` everything to my simple, shared web host.

## Family ######

N. has been sleeping better; adding a LED night light to his room
helped, as he can now find his bottle of water himself without having
to wake us up. He still cries if he threw out all three of his
pacifiers.

He seems to be enjoying video calling lately with his grand-parents.

Today was the KITA event; both E. and I are completely exhausted.

We really notice it when B&M aren't here.

It's been getting colder; up to now we haven't had to really turn on
the heat in the living room or hallway. The bedroom on the other
hand has been cold as too much air gathers in the heater. This is due
to not enough heating water being added to the heating system.
Luckily today the plumber came by to add the water. The renovated
system doesn't allow me to add the water myself. The plumber will
make an adjustment to make that possible again.

Rainy and cold wind, is not a good combination to take the bike to
work; yet I managed to do it every day.

## Work ########

The Deloitte Christmas party took place yesterday. Had a good time
seeing old colleagues back and meeting new ones. Left after eating,
around 21:00. I was still in time home to help put N. to bed.

## Stuff #######

The SD-card in the Nokia 8110 4G got corrupted. It seems to have been
set to "read-only", but there doesn't seem to be a way to reset this
attribute. The drive is still readable, but it doesn't show any more
in KaiOS. When I open the drive in Windows, I can ready and copy the
data, but cannot format the drive, nor can I make any other changes.

Ben Werd created a plan for the next months working on Known CMS.
Feeling the need to help out with resolving the CSS and JavaScript
issues, but family-time and work-time will make it harder for me to
actually deliver anything nice and useful.

Had a thought earlier when doing the dishes that Known might not be
popular amongst devs, because there is WordPress and Drupal it
competes with. And there is also Node.js and the whole Blockchain
ecology which is calling for people's spare-time;

Wondering if there is a market in Africa for sites like Known? All it
takes is a standard Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP stack (LAMP); which
should be cheap to run and easy to maintain.  But yet again, all
development of the open-source project seems to take place in the
"Western World". Some questions come to mind;

1. Which CMS is popular in Africa?
2. Which web host is most popular in Kenia and Nigeria?
3. How much does it cost to own a domain name in these countries?
4. How do people access the Web?

Assuming one of the hurdles is that most people in Africa probably
don't own laptops or desktops, or have access to a PC. Schools and
libraries are probably the only places where people have access to a
"work station". Most phone experience are optimized for consuming
content, but not for creating it; expect for the occasional Tweet or
Instagram picture upload. Not sure if there's anything I can do here.

Just thinking about all of this doesn't make any difference.

Funny how I don't dare writing out freely on my HTTP site, as I do
here on the Small Internet. I guess it helps to not have any real
distractions while I'm immersed in the Small Net...

# Monday, December 2, 2019 ##########################################

So I managed to lose an whole entry I started writing in this blog
note. Not a very good start of the month. Writing this in VS Code.

So far for enjoying Vim. It's been cool, but frustrating, even
after months of forcing myself to use Vim as much as possible. It's
just not worth the effort and time really if you can achieve a lot
more user-friendliness using a modern editor like VS Code.
Losing the work was the drop that made the bucket overflow.

## Family ######

It's been a tough week, with N. getting sick and not being able to
go to the Kita. We had a lot of help from B&M, but they unfortunately
had to return home yesterday.

N. was really good today, until I had to change his diaper and he had
to get ready for dinner. He can be so stubborn! He threw a tantrum
and we cannot keep him sitting on his "time-out" bench anymore as he
is not willing to stay on it, even if we insist. We need to find
some other form of putting him in "time-out"...

## Projects ####

Trying to get my "Open Productivity" system going with using
TaskWarrior and bash scripts, and a very basic PHP script. It works,
but is not optimal. Trying to figure out how to integrate the publish
to the Webhost using TaskWarrior's hooks; but it does not seem to
execute the Bash `aliases`.

Going to try with an actual bash shell script next.
