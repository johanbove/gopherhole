# Monday, December 2, 2019 ##########################################

So I managed to lose an whole entry I started writing in this blog
note. Not a very good start of the month. Writing this in VS Code.

So far for enjoying Vim. It's been cool, but frustrating, even
after months of forcing myself to use Vim as much as possible. It's
just not worth the effort and time really if you can achieve a lot
more user-friendliness using a modern editor like VS Code.
Losing the work was the drop that made the bucket overflow.

## Family ###########################################################

It's been a tough week, with N. getting sick and not being able to
go to the Kita. We had a lot of help from B&M, but they unfortunately
had to return home yesterday.

N. was really good today, until I had to change his diaper and he had
to get ready for dinner. He can be so stubborn! He threw a tantrum
and we cannot keep him sitting on his "time-out" bench anymore as he
is not willing to stay on it, even if we insist. We need to find
some other form of putting him in "time-out"...

## Projects #########################################################

Trying to get my "Open Productivity" system going with using
TaskWarrior and bash scripts, and a very basic PHP script. It works,
but is not optimal. Trying to figure out how to integrate the publish
to the Webhost using TaskWarrior's hooks; but it does not seem to
execute the Bash `aliases`.

Going to try with an actual bash shell script next.
