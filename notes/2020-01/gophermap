A whole month went flying by since my last post. I have been looking
at other things than writing or Gopher in general. Plus, as you may
know, I do keep a private log in Bullet Journal style in a paper
notebook, so there is no real need for me to write all my thoughts
out here. Of course lots has happened in the last weeks, so I do
promise to write out some major things here. But not today.

We're all doing well and are happy.
