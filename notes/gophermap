## Friends ##########################################################
Had a great brunch today with friends, and finally saw their new baby
boy.

Spent most time away from the PC today and enjoyed IRL time.

## Watching #########################################################
Caught up watching an episode of the "Inside Bill's Brain (2019)"[1]
and "Vox Explained" [2] documentaries on Netflix.

## Other ############################################################
The change from summertime to wintertime is confusing my sense of
time. Wishing we could just keep the time set to wintertime
permanently.

Writing this with "Visual Studio Code"[2] 's "zen-mode" layout on.
Had to fix the "tabs to spaces" setting as it had reverted back to
spaces instead of tabs and it messed up the gophermap links.

Added more content to the "twtxt" article on https://indieweb.org.

Read through more twtxt feeds from other users and got myself
registered on the "we-are-twtxt" registry [1]

## Family ###########################################################
Wonderful warm Autumn day. Had a great time in the park with Nathan.

## twtxt ############################################################
I've set up the twtxt [1] publishing app on WSL on my PC. It works
great, and it's enlightening to publish it all text-first! I've made
it work so that every update to my twtxt.txt file is also pushed to
my site at https://johanbove.info and then a mirror-copy is also scp
copied to this gopher site.

I keep a Bullet Journal method paper notebook. It's my personal log.

## Tired ############################################################

Keeping it short today as I'm really tired. Last night Nathan woke up
a couple of times and it really messed me up. Yay, friday night's as
a parent of a young kid...

He's wonderful and we love him with all our hearts!

## Gophering along ##################################################

I've been spending way too much time on #Gopher servers in the last
couple of days.

The Gopher Web is intriguing and fascinating and I totall understand
the attraction of an ad-free, cookie-free, not-for-profit, underground
(-ish) alternative to today's crowded and over-commericially
exploited (according to many) HTTP Web.

It's not super straightforward to access, even-though there are good
dedicated free browsers[1] (for all platforms) available that totally
support the Gopher protocol.

But I have the feeling that because the Gopher Web is a little harder
to access, it is actually part of the attractiveness. Lots of humans
tired of the current state of the WWW, who still want to publish
content and share stuff, are finding an alternative, albeit
archaic, in the Gopher web.

Setting up a Gopher server wasn't hard either thanks to open-source
software from dedicated hobbyist developers.

Formatting plain-text files has been interesting too. It's amazing
how much effort some Gopher Hole Phloggers take to create beautiful
ASCII art and line-out their paragraphs!

Discovering Phlogs has been an eye-opener and inspiring. There are
many Phloggers[2] who are publishing worthwile stories and interesting
articles in plain text files in their Gopher holes or gopher burrows.

And I had some fun first-time experiences too playing a funny
text-based adventure game called "Lost Pig" (2007)[3] - it's an
interactive story, with lots of funny dialogue and plenty of
character which by itself is also proof that Gopher pages can also be
entertaining.

The Floodgap Gopher (Gopher proxy) site is a great place to start.

# October 23rd, 2019 ################################################

Installed Jaruzel's "Gopher Browser For Windows"[1] and it seems for
now the best way to "surf" the Gopher World Not-so-Wide Web.

Also tinkering around with the formatting of these notes, perhaps a
little too much. Still amazed by how much time other Gopherhole
owners seem to be spending on formatting their files by hand!
How do they even do a left and right alignment?

But then again, why bother? Nobody is ever going to read this, except
for myself :-)

Played my first Text-adventure "Lost Pig (2007)" [2] - had a tough,
but fun time discovering the game's story. I did get a little stuck,
so had to glance at the game's walkthrough. These text-adventures
are great for improving ones imagination and memory skills.
Note to self: try to get Nathan to also have a go at it - if these
games will still be around in the next five to eight years or so.

## Starting to get it - the Gopher Protocol #########################

So what the Gopher protocol adds to the Web is a text-only browsing
experience while providing each site with a consistent menu
out-of-the-box, if you coded it right. An Apache Web server can
server plain-text files pretty well too, but of course it doesn't
come with the hyperlinks. I'm starting to get the idea why Gopher is
still being used.

## The Phlog format #################################################

As I'm currently adding content to this file, I'm starting to also
realize that a single file won't do it. Going to have to add posts to
its own file. Perhaps I won't keep this up for a long time however.

## Why does Gopher not like UTF-8? ##################################

A question that's been on my mind today. I've seen the Germans go
through the trouble of not using their umlauts and other non-ascii
characters. Perhaps that's the reason why Gopher never really took
off outside of the US. How do I write UTF-8 content?

## PyGopherd is old #################################################

The Github code repository shows commits from 18 years ago, in 2002
to be precise.

hFirst Pygopherd commit on Github	/URL:https://github.com/jgoerzen/pygopherd/commit/1b320ecafa7c705232e042b1a5cc6bc555637ba5

## Wondering how to align my text like it's 1991 ####################

Baud.baby[1] has phlog entries with beautifully justified paragraphs.
How did they do that? - aparently it's all hand-crafted!

## IndieWeb #########################################################

You know what I really love about the #Indieweb is how all
documentation and communication between the enthusiasts is so well
organised and perfectly made available for future reference and it
all is linked up really well together. You can keep up-to-date with
the latest info by simply visiting the IRC chat logs from time to
time.

# October 20th, 2019 ################################################

Got intrigued by the Gopher concept after Peter Molnar on the
Indieweb IRC chat mentioned this:

> petermolnar: btw if anyone if out of ideas for project, you can

Yes, I realize it's October 2019, and not October 1991 so I was
really surprised that the Gopher Protocol is alive-and-kicking!

Literally, today is the very first time I browsed the Gopher Web and
it feels extremely old-school, bringing back the good old felz of
text-only browsing with Lynx.
