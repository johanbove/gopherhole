# Sunday, March 8, 2020 #############################################

Recently finished reading  "The Demon Haunted World" by Carl Sagan.

## Family ###########################################################

Spent a nice day yesterday visiting the Altenberger Dom [2] near the
quaint village of Odental.

Our family is getting worried about the situation in Italy where they
don't seem to get a grip on the COVID-19 outbreak. We hear stories
of people breaking quaraintine regulations because they still wanted
to go on their skiing trip, at then they even got sick and on top
they went to the emergency room! The stupidity of people has no
boundaries!

## Stuff ############################################################

And I'm back at writing one post a month here. We've been on holiday
in Italy and I left my PC at home; plus I tried to write more in my
BuJo journal. I'm still balancing between paper and digital journals.

## Scuttlebutt ######################################################

Lately I've been learning more about peer-to-peer networks,
specially the Scuttlebutt [1] platform is really cool.

So I have been pretty much neglecting this old-school centralized
Gopher site. I'm probably due to abandon it soon unfortunately
because of the new-found interest in p2p network.

So you can find me on Scuttlebutt with the "johan" identity, with
this public key ID:

```
@4XHLGF4UDOGiS5oqiDUjN97cKVBExloikIIGMiNjHq0=.ed25519
```

If I find a way to syndicate posts from here to scuttlebutt and back,
I will probably return back to Gopher. The social interaction on
SSB is simply too good and my curiosity into this new way of
exchanging data is complete.

And this is my return to Vim since a long time and I forgot most
keyboard commands again already.

Check out the site above if you're interested in joining the P2P Web.
