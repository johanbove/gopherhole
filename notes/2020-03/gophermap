# Sunday, March 8, 2020 #############################################

And I'm back at writing one post a month here.

Lately I've been learning more about peer-to-peer networks,
specially the [Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz/) platform is
cool.

So I have been pretty much neglecting this old-school centralized
Gopher site. I'm probably due to abandon it soon unfortunately
because of the new-found interest in p2p network.

So you can find me on Scuttlebutt with the "@johan" identity, with
this public key ID:

```
@4XHLGF4UDOGiS5oqiDUjN97cKVBExloikIIGMiNjHq0=.ed25519
```

If I find a way to syndicate posts from here to scuttlebutt and back,
I will probably return back to Gopher. The social interaction on
SSB is simply too good and my curiosity into this new way of
exchanging data is complete.

And this is my return to Vim since a long time and I forgot most
keyboard commands again already.
