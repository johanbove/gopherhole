## Family

We managed today to spend the day at home. I worked a bit while
N. was distracted by TV and playing by himself. We asked for a dr's
note so I can claim the lost days with our health insurance. It's
covered.

Since spending the whole day in the house is not a lot of fun for a
2 year old, I took him to the park and the playground. His pants
were full of mud as he loves running through the puddles. I had to
restrain him a little from jumping too lively in the muddy water
puddles as he didn't have the right shoes and pants on. Tomorrow we
should put on his gummit boots and Matsch-hosen, as Germans call
them.

I still need to catch up with these things:

- BuJo notes from the last week.
- PatchWork testing and fixing the image rendering.
- Still do not entirely understand well how SSB works.
- D.F. reached out to me to remove his full name from a Pocket post.
- Tried subscribing to Wired Magazine, but I messed up and selected
the US edition by mistake. Contacted the Cond√© Nast customer service.
- No news yet regarding the Internet upgrade. Apparently the promo is
really popular and they are behind in sending the new modems /r
outers.
- Still missing riding my bike to work!
- And I do miss being in a different environment then at home too.
- Didn't sleep very well last night. Was woken up by the chronic
thing.

The Corona virus has somehow reached our lives now too. The whole of
Italy is now a "red zone", and we were there ten days ago, our son
cannot go to the kita until next Monday. We need to scramble up a
plan to get through the rest of the week...

B&M decided to drive all the way home because of how Austria seems
to want to close the border with Italy.

Recently finished reading  "The Demon Haunted World" by Carl Sagan.

Spent a nice day yesterday visiting the Altenberger Dom [2] near the
quaint village of Odental.

Our family is getting worried about the situation in Italy where they
don't seem to get a grip on the COVID-19 outbreak. We hear stories
of people breaking quaraintine regulations because they still wanted
to go on their skiing trip, at then they even got sick and on top
they went to the emergency room! The stupidity of people has no
boundaries!

## Stuff ############################################################

And I'm back at writing one post a month here. We've been on holiday
in Italy and I left my PC at home; plus I tried to write more in my
BuJo journal. I'm still balancing between paper and digital journals.

## Scuttlebutt ######################################################

Lately I've been learning more about peer-to-peer networks,
specially the Scuttlebutt [1] platform is really cool.

h[1] https://scuttlebutt.nz	/URL:https://scuttlebutt.nz

So I have been pretty much neglecting this old-school centralized
Gopher site. I'm probably due to abandon it soon unfortunately
because of the new-found interest in p2p network.

So you can find me on Scuttlebutt with the "johan" identity, with
this public key ID:

```
@4XHLGF4UDOGiS5oqiDUjN97cKVBExloikIIGMiNjHq0=.ed25519
```

If I find a way to syndicate posts from here to scuttlebutt and back,
I will probably return back to Gopher. The social interaction on
SSB is simply too good and my curiosity into this new way of
exchanging data is complete.

And this is my return to Vim since a long time and I forgot most
keyboard commands again already.

Check out the site above if you're interested in joining the P2P Web.
