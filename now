What am I focused on now in my life? (Updated: 2019-11-02)

> This is a now page, and if you have your own site, you should make
one, too. [1]

## Work Time

I work on Web Applications as a Studio Lead at Deloitte Digital [2] in
DÃ¼sseldorf. I'm contributing to interesting projects based upon
Vue.js and SASS (SCSS), including Jest for unit testing, building and
compiling our code with Webpack. We're even looking at consuming
Hypermedia APIs with Traverson and introducing Behaviour Driven
Development with Gherkin and Cucumber.

## Personal Time

Taking care and spending as much time as I can with my son and
family.

When he's in bed I'm contributing some spare-time to Indieweb
projects like the Known CMS, which I use on my "social" site. I'm
trying to keep up with the Indieweb technologies and concepts, like
Webmentions. POSSE, etc.

Recently started this Gopher site.

Reading "The Demon Haunted World" by Carl Sagan. It's one of the
toughest books, theme-wise, of him to get through. But since I'm
reading it in my head with Carl Sagan's particular tone and voice it
is still enlightning.
