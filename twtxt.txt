2019-10-26T00:26:47+02:00	@<ckipp https://chronica.xyz/hallway.txt> https://webring.xxiivv.com/hallway.html looks amazing! How does it work?

2019-10-26T13:44:52+02:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> The IndieWeb.org twtxt article is only a stub - me copy-pasting content from other sites - could use some more sections - @t himself found it an interesting concept

2019-10-27T23:45:50+01:00	Updated my daily journal at gopher://gopher.johanbove.info:70/notes
2019-10-28T08:57:34+01:00	My gopher site is about 38K big - still plenty of space left on the 1.24MB floppy disk
2019-10-28T22:11:06+01:00	@<mdosch https://mdosch.de/twtxt.txt> I thought it was a nice practice to share interesting twtxt-ers through a follow tweet
2019-10-28T22:16:44+01:00	Discovered some new twtxt _followers_ by glancing at my web server logs.. Feeling so l33t now.
2019-10-28T22:59:57+01:00	@<mdom https://domgoergen.com/twtxt/mdom.txt> The news site at gopher://taz.de:70/ is really cool. How did you make it?
2019-10-28T23:01:59+01:00	@<von https://tilde.town/~von/twtxt.txt> Why do you want to keep your twtxt.txt more private if I may ask so?
2019-10-28T23:08:48+01:00	One of the biggest twtxt feed files I could find is still only 127 KB big
2019-10-30T13:05:40+0100	twtxt is über cool
2019-10-30T13:16:27+0100	@<adiabatic https://www.frogorbits.com/twtxt.txt> the 0 indicates the txt file type in gophermaps. Gopherholes are made up of mostly plain text files. Does that answer your question?
2019-10-30T13:21:16+0100	Made my own super basic twtxt client in 3 lines of code as a bashrc function. #l33t
2019-10-30T13:27:11+0100	@<reednj http://twtxt.xyz/u/reednj.txt> Thanks for making and hosting http://twtxt.xyz - the agreggation of twtxts users, tweets and tags is really cool
2019-10-30T13:51:06+0100	Listing to a Deezer playlist with a mix of Leftfield, Moderat, Amon Tobin, The Chemical Brothers, etc
2019-10-30T14:51:43+0100	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> twtxt.txt file splitting for achival is an interesting idea. Should not need to be yearly only. High volume feeds could split faster. Needs a spec though.
2019-10-30T15:48:00+0100	@<von https://tilde.town/~von/twtxt.txt> having topic-specific twtxt feeds is not a silly idea. Not sure if the clients allow easy switching though.
2019-10-30T16:22:26+0100	@<von https://tilde.town/~von/twtxt.txt> Understanding you. For me: keeping a bullet-journal on a paper notebook helped me herd my chaotic mind into manageable streams. See https://bulletjournal.com
2019-10-31T07:15:21+01:00	Proud of myself for achieving a 10 day streak of writing a daily journal log entry.
2019-10-31T11:28:01+0100	Should I do another Movember campaign this year or not?
2019-10-31T11:46:34+0100	This will show my age: do kids these days know what LAN-parties were?
2019-10-31T22:32:38+01:00	Why the heck people would deliberately buy an iphone XR is beyond me.
2019-10-31T22:57:41+01:00	I feel like I only scratched the surface of what Vim really is capable off.
2019-10-31T22:59:12+01:00	Considering: https://indieweb.org/Twitter#How_to_unfollow_everyone_but_still_read_their_tweets

2019-10-31T23:24:19+01:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> (re: Splitting) Good stuff kas++ What command or script did you use to split by year?
2019-11-01T00:53:17+01:00	Vim really has the best commands for typo-fixing: r, a
2019-11-01T14:47:38+01:00	@<frogor https://www.frogorbits.com/twtxt.txt> (re: iphone xr) compared to the Iphone 7. XR might be more powerful but it's clumsy to hold as big and heavy. Does not feel like a phone at all.
2019-11-01T15:07:14+01:00	Anyone still using Skype actually? Seems like the service completely lost to WhatsApp.
2019-11-02T20:34:21+01:00	Donated 500ml of my own blood today at the Uniklinik in Düsseldorf to help others in need.
2019-11-02T23:36:37+01:00	As my hardware is getting older, I feel myself getting more attracted to retro-computing.
2019-11-02T23:50:10+01:00	Enjoying the constraints of the Gopher protocol as a minimalistic zen-mode kind of online publishing revival.
2019-11-03T21:09:51+01:00	My 2014 Android Moto-X is finally out-of-order - the battery life is close to flat-lining and when it boots it gets stuck for a really long time in the _optimizing apps_ mode. The case is cracked. Goodbye old friend.

2019-11-04T14:02:43+0100	@<adiabatic https://www.frogorbits.com/twtxt.txt> (re: iphone xr) True. The battery life is great - especially since it is new. FaceID is very handy indeed. The bigger screen estate is amazing too. Also esim might be cool - if only my provider would support it.
2019-11-04T14:43:04+0100	German grammar is really tricky sometimes when it comes down to writing user-interface labels
2019-11-04T23:38:02+01:00	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> (re: bullet journal) Agreeing that BuJo kind of saved my mind too. It now takes me about three months to fill up 251 pages with tasks, notes and events.
2019-11-05T09:02:29+01:00	Funny how not that long ago I made a remark to a friend who was keeping all his notes as txt files and now I am looking at doing exactly that. txt will probably be the one format that will be around for a very long time still.

2019-11-12T08:35:01+01:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> I like your gopher server's formatting, nice and clean and how did you implement the TLS certificate?
2019-11-15T21:59:35+01:00	Signing my twtxt with my johanbove@keybase.io account from today onwards

2019-12-09T22:22:57+01:00	Twtxt is real enough. Feels funny to be so open writing here, yet nobody knows twtxt.txt is here - part of the charm
2019-12-09T22:25:24+01:00	Opening the man page for tail feels very vestigial

2020-01-03T16:36:53+0100	The twtxt.xyz domain is a 1000 days old and expires on 2020-04-07. Wondering if anyone will renew it?
2020-01-06T16:18:54+0100	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> [re: abandoned ideas] Thanks for the inspiration! How do you keep track of projects now? Do you know about TaskWarrior?

2020-04-16T21:58:24+02:00	We are thinking of you Grandpa Ivo. May the peaches be forever ripe and juicy where you are.

2020-04-30T00:00:00+02:00	I'm enjoying listening to music on my re-discovered #MiniDisc players. Pop in the disc, press play and listen to about 150 minutes of your own music in clear digital quality.
2020-05-07T21:57:47+02:00	Was feeling super nervous and on-the-edge earlier this evening. A cup of chamomile tea later I am feeling again more relaxed.

2020-05-18T14:23:08+0200	Honestly never realized before Beakerbrowser that peer-to-peer could be used to share markdown, JavaScript and html files.
2020-05-22T14:05:34+02:00	Of course the first thing you do after buying media on DVD is to fire up #Handbrake to make a local copy - those discs are just too fragile!
2020-05-25T22:13:54+02:00	Who needs games when you can have fun with contributing to open-source!
2020-07-17T16:26:38+0200	Yeah. I'm still here. Just been busy doing something on Beakerbrowser and Scuttlebutt.
2020-07-17T16:28:36+0200	That Twitter admin hack shows how important it is to own our own online content and even our own platforms for posting on the Web. Want to learn more? Make yourself a cup of your favorite drink and have a look at https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started

2020-07-27T15:35:56+0200	Since a couple of months on peer-to-peer Web and I'm really convinced that as long as isps do not start messing with firewalls, this could really be the next step in a real Internet of humans.
2020-08-12T13:39:16+0200	Hello Twtxt from a Xubuntu 18.04 machine!
2020-08-12T13:42:20+0200	@<Leo https://www.gkbrk.com/twtxt.txt> Sorry to disappoint. I think I have Finger running on my Raspberrypi but didn't make it public.
2020-08-12T13:43:49+0200	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> I will probably check out twtxt.net later. Can we use it without registering for an account?
2020-08-12T13:48:46+0200	The Mozilla layoffs are really worrying me about the future of the Web.
2020-08-16T21:41:23+0200	Fun setting up basic productivity tools with Syncthing and Todo.txt
2020-08-16T21:44:14+0200	Checking out Todo.txt because it literally is all text files. But will probably still move back to TaskWarrior because I will miss annotations and other features.
2020-08-16T21:46:18+0200	Signing off for the week. Good night!
