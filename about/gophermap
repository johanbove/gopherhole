This gopher hole is run by Johan Bove.

I keep this Gopher server running on a Raspberry Pi 3, literally
sitting on my desk at home.

--- Please don't hack it. ---

I was curious about this other "Web" called Gopher and decided that I
would like to be part of it. Not sure what exactly I'm going to share
on this server, but I promise to keep it somewhat useful or
entertaining.
