You know what I really ❤️ about the #Indieweb is how all documentation and
communication between the enthusiasts is so well organised and perfectly
made available for future reference and it all is linked up really well
together. You can keep up-to-date with the latest info by simply visiting
the IRC chat logs from time to time.

Got intrigued by the Gopher concept after Peter Molnar on the Indieweb IRC chat
mentioned this:

Yes, I realize it's October 2019, and not October 1991 so I was really
surprised that the Gopher Protocol is alive-and-kicking!

Literally, today is the very first time I browsed the Gopher Web and it feels
very old-school, bringing back the good old felz of text-only browsing with
Lynx.
