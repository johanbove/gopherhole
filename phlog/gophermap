Yes, I realize it's October 2019, and not October 1991.
The Gopher Protocol is alive-and-kicking!
Literally, today is the very first time I'm browsing the gopher web.
I got this little server running on a Raspberry Pi 3.
The site is still only available offline. Not sure if it will ever see public day light.
