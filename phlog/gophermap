## Starting to get it - the Gopher Protocol

So what the Gopher protocol adds to the Web is a text-only browsing
experience while providing each site with a consistent menu out-of-the-box,
if you coded it right. An Apache Web server can server plain-text files pretty
well too, but of course it doesn't come with the hyperlinks.
I'm starting to get the idea why Gopher is still being used.

## The Phlog format

As I'm currently adding content to this file, I'm starting to also realize
that a single file won't do it. Going to have to add posts to its own file.

## Why does Gopher not like UTF-8?

A question that's been on my mind today. I've seen the Germans go through
the trouble of not using their umlauts and other non-ascii characters.
Perhaps that's the reason why Gopher never really took off outside of the
US. How do I write UTF-8 content?

## PyGopherd is old

The Github code repository shows commits from 18 years ago, in 2002 to be
precise.

## IndieWeb

You know what I really love about the #Indieweb is how all documentation and
communication between the enthusiasts is so well organised and perfectly
made available for future reference and it all is linked up really well
together. You can keep up-to-date with the latest info by simply visiting
the IRC chat logs from time to time.

Got intrigued by the Gopher concept after Peter Molnar on the Indieweb IRC chat
mentioned this:

Yes, I realize it's October 2019, and not October 1991 so I was really
surprised that the Gopher Protocol is alive-and-kicking!

Literally, today is the very first time I browsed the Gopher Web and it feels
very old-school, bringing back the good old felz of text-only browsing with
Lynx.
