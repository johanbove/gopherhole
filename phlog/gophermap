# October 20, 2019

Got intrigued by the Gopher concept after Peter Molnar on the Indieweb IRC chat mentioned this:

    petermolnar: btw if anyone if out of ideas for project, you can always make your site available over gopher :)

Yes, I realize it's October 2019, and not October 1991 so I was really surprised that the Gopher Protocol is alive-and-kicking!

Literally, today is the very first time I'm browsed the gopher web and it feels like a breath of fresh air!
